1. By plotting a histogram of the residuals, we can observe a normal distribution. The normal test is not appropriate for large samples. The p-value, 2.5e-127, from linear regression is also less than our significance level, alpha=0.05. Therefore we can conclude the ratings are increasing w.r.t. time.

2. Hard to distinguish what the true signal is however, this KF can capture the spikes in temperature much more frequently when compared to Ex.3. The residuals also have a normal distribution.
