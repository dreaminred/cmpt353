1. The best fit line is a prediction of ratings based on time. The linregress function uses the least square 
method to find a linear relationship between the variables. The fit slope describes the rate of increase of
rankings with respect to the timestamp units (3.52e-08 rating/timestamp unit)(timestamp unit is seconds in 
this case). A positive slope indicates the score is increasing with time. However a linear model 
may not be correct as the scores approach an asymptote. The intercept is an offset for fitting and 
has units of rating. The data type is float64.

2. The least square method minimizes the error function between the prediction and truth values. 
An exponential decay function may have an easier time capturing the trend. 
The timestamp values are the number of seconds after the year 1970. We used numerical timestamps to calculate 
the rating prediction. Then, we plotted the predictions at their respective timestamps in yyyy-mm format.
