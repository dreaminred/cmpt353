1. NumPy was easier to pick up and start using with the commands but it didn't offer the visual display of the data like pandas. 
   With NumPyI had to individually check the totals.csv and counts.csv files for the axes. Printing pandas dataframes is also very convenient as the labels are shown
   and we are not left with only indices.

2. I ran the notebook on sfu.syzygy.ca. The pandas method took approximately twice as long to run when compared to the for loops method. This might be partly due
   to usage of the dataframe apply() method (O(n)) for changing the date format since it uses a for loop.
