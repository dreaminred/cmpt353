Note: The sfu syzygy server crashed at around ~ 11pm Oct 14th. I was not able to grab a copy of summary.ipynyb however I was able to print the page to gather my results.
1. The log transform created the best normally distributed data.
2. The (log of) number of comments on weekdays versus. weekends comes from the same distribution. 
3. With a large amount of data, n>1000, the t-test itself is robust enough by taking the mean and variance of the two samples.
We know from CLT, the distribution of mean and variances are a normal, even though the population distribution might not be.
4.I would answer this however sfu.syzygy.ca stopped working at the last second. I would look at the mean and variance of each distribution and the statistics in each approach.
