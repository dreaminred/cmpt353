Question 1:

reddit-0 : 0m6.612s

reddit-2 with schema: 0m13.970s
reddit-2 without schema: 0m17.060s

reddit-2 without .cache(): 0m17.115s
reddit-2 with .cache(): 0m16.932s

Question2:
Reading the files is the slowest part of the process.


Question 3:
Cache() is applied before the groupBy, and join functions. I originally thought that the join would the most computationally intensive portion however it seems reading the files is the bottleneck.
