1.  The kNN model produces the highest accuracy which does make sense since the algorithm is based on distance, which is why the normalization step is important. The random forest model's accuracy tended to be lower than the kNN model by a few hundreths. The Naive Bayes model was the only model that benefitted more from the HSV transformation than the LAB transformation. Perhaps the distributions produced by the the HSV transformation allow for a higher accuracy in the gaussian process.

2. Yes, generally, the false predictions are very close to the true cities. Some of the examples are Portland and Seattle (~200km apart), Edmonton and Calgary (~250km). These city paris share the same climate patterns. To further imrpove our model accuracy, we can add features such as relative humidity, pressure which can be especially helpful for distinguishing based on altitude, and PM2.5 concentration/AQI for pollution levels.
